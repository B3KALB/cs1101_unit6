# Welcome to the Unit 6 Discussion Forum!

# Use the terms "equivalent" and "identical" to distinguish between objects and values.

identical = ''

# Illustrate the difference further using your own examples with Python lists and the “is” operator.
# is operator

# Using your own Python list examples, explain how objects, references, and aliasing relate to one another.
lists1 = [{}]
lists2 = []
lists3 = []

# Finally, create your own example of a function that modifies a list passed in as an argument. 
# Hence, describe what your function does in terms of arguments, parameters, objects, and references. 
def modify_a_list(a):
    print(a)






# Create your own unique examples for this assignment. Do not copy them from the textbook or any other source.

# The code and its output must be explained technically whenever asked. 
# The explanation can be provided before or after the code, or in the form of code comments within the code. 
# For any descriptive type question, Your answer must be at least 150 words.

# End your discussion post with one question related to programming fundamentals learned in this unit 
# from which your colleagues can formulate a response or generate further discussion. 
# Remember to post your initial response as early as possible, preferably by Sunday evening,
